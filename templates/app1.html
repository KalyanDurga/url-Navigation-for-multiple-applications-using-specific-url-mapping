   <center><h3 >Early life and background </h3></center>
    <p>
        Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family with roots in Uttarakhand.[11][12] He is the youngest of three children of Pan
         Singh and Devaki Devi.[13][14][15][16] His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand.[17] His parents moved from 
         Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in Ranchi.[18] Unlike
          Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname as Dhauni.[17][needs copy edit]
          Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team,[19] but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, 
          one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team.[20] His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular 
          wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 
          Championship, where he performed well.[16]

    <center><h3>Early career</h3></center>
    <p>In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket Association Vice President and Ranchi District Cricket President, to play for the Central Coal
         Fields Limited (CCL) team.[23] Till 1998 Dhoni, who was in 12th grade, had never played professional cricket. At CCL, he got an opportunity to bat higher up the 
         order, where he performed exceptionally, which had helped CCL move to the A division.[24] Deval Sahay, impressed by his performance, pushed for his selection in 
         the Bihar team.[25] Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket team and eventually the senior Bihar Ranji Team within one year.In the 1998–99 Cooch 
         Behar Trophy, Dhoni played for the U-19 Bihar team and scored 176 runs in 5 matches (7 innings). However, Bihar finished fourth in the group of six and did not 
         make it to the quarter-finals. Dhoni was not picked for the East Zone U-19 squad (CK Nayudu Trophy) or Rest of India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and Vinoo Mankad 
         Trophy). In the 1999–2000 Cooch Behar Trophy, the Bihar U-19 cricket team made it to the finals, where Dhoni's 84 helped Bihar post a total of 357.[28] Nevertheless,
          Bihar's efforts were thwarted by Punjab's 839 with Dhoni's future teammate Yuvraj Singh making 358.[29][30] Dhoni's contribution in the tournament included 488 runs 
          (9 matches, 12 innings), 5 fifties, 17 catches and 7 stumpings.[31] Dhoni made it to the East Zone U-19 squad for the CK Nayudu trophy in the 1999–2000 season but 
          scored only 97 runs in four matches, as East Zone lost all four matches and finished last in the tournament.[32][33][34]</p>
